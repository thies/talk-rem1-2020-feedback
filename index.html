					## General Remarks<span class="subtitle"><br/></span>
					* Apologies for slow turn-around!
					* Thanks for the interesting reports!
						- Huge variety of approaches.
						- Many specialised/personal/idiosyncratic arguments.
						- Ambitious angles
					* A lot of hard work was evident!
					* I hope the personalised feedback was helpful
						- Fully anonymous marking, I have no idea who produced a report
					* Challenge
						- Improve lines of argument and evidence-based reasoning...
						- ... while not killing off the creativity and ambition

					## The task<span class="subtitle"><br/>(just to refresh our memory)</span>

					* The economic ramifications of the Covid pandemic:

					 	- a) hit real estate investments harder than investments in other mainstream asset classes,
					 	- b) diminished real estate’s role in mixed asset portfolios, and
					 	- c) will lead to more pronounced differences between the risk-return profiles of real estate sectors in the future."

					## Guidance <span class="subtitle"><br/>(broadly matched to subquestions)</span>

					* Guidance
						- You should engage with qualitative and quantitative academic or industry research extensively. Clearly identify and use sources of relevant data such that it adds compelling evidence for the arguments made. [a-c]
						- Demonstrate a deep understanding of the drivers of investment returns for different real estate sectors [a].
						- Demonstrate a deep understanding of the factors that influence real estate’s position in multi-asset investment portfolios relative to other asset classes. [b]
						- Include own empirical analysis that is thoughtfully applied to the research questions ("chose your angle wisely..."). [a or b or c]

					* How did we arrive at mark?
						- a + b + c + literature work + empirics/own research

					## Literature work <span class="subtitle"><br/>Reading is research!</span>
					* Most were avid readers. Great!
						- Many comments on "effective/efficient use of literature". This saves time and space!
						- Is it OK if 90% of "my" findings have been shown by others before? YES! The last few % are the contribution!
					* Literature everywhere, not just in Lit. Review
					 	- "...link any results, wherever possible, back to the literature ('I find X which is in line with Y's finding...')"
					* Minor, but important
					 	- "You may use any referencing system, so this is only a suggestion: Name (Year) comes most natural in our field..."
						- (Note to self: make style compulsory next time)

				<textarea data-template>
					## Empirics <span class="subtitle"><br/>Establishing causality / estimating correlations</span>
					* Identification is difficult (we try to teach you a bit more)
					* It's a dilemma:
						- Reliable identifcation is rare case. Limited to few, often not that interesting minor aspects. Typical
						- Great, big topics are usually not identifiable. "Effect of Covid?" Good luck
					* Acknowledge challenge, discuss a perfect case. Make concessions - and justify them.
					* Tackle question from several imperfect angles and aggregate evidence?
					* Economic story?
					* Empirically feasible?
					* This is difficult and needs time, skills and experience! Yes, we were lenient.

			<section data-markdown>
				<textarea data-template>
					## Writing <span class="subtitle"><br/></span>
					* C-C-C: Context - Content - Conclusions
					* Emulate economic papers, not industry reports
						- Bullet
						- points
						- are
						- ugly.
					* Flow of argument is all-important. Bad story-telling kills the most beautiful regression.
					* Focus on tables and charts: 20/80 rule - They receive most of the attention.
					* Proofreading is for wimps. Not.
